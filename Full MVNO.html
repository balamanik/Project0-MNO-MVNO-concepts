        <h2> Concept of Full Mobile Virtual Network Operator </h2>

	<p> as we have seen in the <a href="C:\Users\bala_\OneDrive\Documents\Havard programme	\project0\Project0-MNO-MVNO-concepts\rentedhouse.html"> Own House</a> page, we are going to 	explore the similarities of MVNO and Rented house. </p>

<p> Mobile Virtual Network Operations could be catgorised as the followings based on the way they wish to operate. the model of MVNO varies based on the network/business elements falls under the MNO or MVNO operator. </p>

	<Ol>
		<li> Full MVNO or Thick MVNO:they will have similar architecture components as MNO 		except 	their own radio access network MAST. </li>
		<li> Enhanced service provider MVNO: they will have similar architecture as MNO except 		radio access and corenetwork.</li>
		<li> Service provider MVNO: they will have similar architecture as MNO except radio 			access, corenetwork and applications and services.</li>
		<li> Light or thin MVNO: they will handle only sales and marketting areas and host MNO 		will provide all the technical architecture and support.This concept is similar 		to <a href="C:\Users\bala_\OneDrive\Documents\Havard programme	\project0\Project0-		MNO-MVNO-concepts\rentaroom.html"> Rented Room concept.</a></li>
	</ol>

	<ul>
	<p> MVNO has the followings:</p>
		<li> <p> MNO might have their own network infrastructure.</p> </li>
		<li><p> MNO might their own HLR (Home Location Register) which contains subscriber 		details including location information. 			</p></li>
		<li><p> MNO might have full control over their network as well as the 				subscribers.<p/></li>
		<li> MNO could be act as an Mobile virtual network enabler(MVNE) to offer virtual 			network operations either full or ligh MVNO networks. Please see the <a href="C:				\Users\bala_\OneDrive\Documents\Havard programme\project0\Project0-MNO-MVNO-		concepts\full MVNO.html"> MVNO</a> page for further details</li>
