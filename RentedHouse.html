	<ul>
		<p> If you have a Rented house:</p>
		<br>
		<li> <p> you won't have ownership of the house but renting it out for a rent 					payment.</p> </li>
		<li><p> your name will not be registered with land rigistry or 							similar governmental body against the property. 					</p></li>
		<li><p> you cann't alter, sell or rent your full or partial 							house.<p/></li>
		<li> you pay council or local authority taxes and charges as like an owner of a 				house,for regular waste collection, maintanance of your roads, parks and other 			amenities etc..</li>
		<li><p> you can invite friends and families at 	anytime but you may have to 					inform land loard.</p></li>
	</ul>

		<p> Light or thin MVNO: they will handle only sales and marketting areas and host MNO 				will provide all the technical 	architecture and support.This concept is 			similar to <a href="C:\Users\bala_\OneDrive\Documents\Havard 	programme					\project0\Project0-MNO-MVNO-concepts\rentaroom.html"> Rented Room 					concept.</a></li>
