# Project0-MNO-MVNO-concepts
Mobile Virtual operatror (MVNO) concept is a fairly new concept used in the Mobile operator world.
Wekipedia.org defines "A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a wireless communications services provider that does not own the wireless network infrastructure over which it provides services to its customers."
MVNO operations are varies one to another based on the MVNO operator's capacity. this varies froma reseller model to Full MVNO model.
i have tried to explain the MVNO concept in general and the different kinds of MVNO in perticular  in a layman terms.
Whilst the concept of rented room explains the least MVNO model - reseller model, the rented house tries to explain a full fledged MVNO model.
MNO is being assumed as an Ownhouse.
